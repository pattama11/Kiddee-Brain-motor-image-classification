# Brain Motor Imagery Classification

## Project Overview
### Challenges and Motivation:
- This repository is a part of the weekly hackathon activity in Super AI Engineer Development Program (Season 4). This 5th week is named "Brain Motor Imagery Classification".
- According to current statistics, Thailand has issues with children not having as good a quality of life as they should. For example, children suffer from depression due to pressure in various areas such as studies, social problems, and relationships with those around them.

### Problem-solving Approach:
- The LUMINOS application can measure the quality of life of students in schools using "EEG" with the following parameters: anxiety, anger, depression, nervousness, lack of self-control, and vulnerability. We adhere to the principles of creating educational standards and improving the quality of life for children.
- The process of using Brain Wave data to classify and develop it into an application involves the following steps: Input > Pre-processing > Feature Engineering > Output Prediction by ensemble method with 3 Models (Random Forest, Light Gradient Boost Machine, Gradient Boost Classifier) > Output as classification.

### Feasibility of Real-world Application:
- For the application to be used effectively in real situations, it needs to collect data in more contexts or emotional states. Only then can it be applied in both government and private organizations.
